# Discovering Quantum Computing
Quantum computing, enhanced by quantum physics principles like superposition, entanglement, and interference, holds the potential to drastically change problem-solving in fields where classical computers lag. Unlike classical computing, quantum computing shines in solving problems with a massive number of variables, offering solutions classical computers can't achieve due to their operating limitations. 

This is the reason why I took this course to keep up to date with new technologies such as quantum computing.
